# Welcome-to-CHC


Since the 1980s, hysterectomy, or uterus-removal surgery, has been extremely common and marked by large racial differences. It's not clear whether these racial differences are because of legitimate medical need or inequitable treatment by the healthcare system. The Carolina Hysterectomy Cohort (CHC) evaluates what's driving these long-standing racial differences: medical need or the culture of healthcare ?

The main objectives of the CHC are to:
1.	Determine the extent to which the clinical threshold for hysterectomy, number of previous alternative treatments, and desire for future fertility vary by race/ethnicity.
2.	Determine the extent to which minority hysterectomy patients are differentially likely to be treated by low-volume providers and by practices with high propensity to perform hysterectomy.
3.	Determine whether symptomatic minority women experience shorter time to hysterectomy or fewer alternative treatments before hysterectomy.

## Methods 
CHC uses electronic medical record data from a large, diverse health system in a high-hysterectomy U.S. region (2012 â€“ 2019).


## Collaborators
We work with closely with many collaborators, including [The Doll Lab Group]( https://www.thedolllabgroup.com/ ) at University of Washington Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, the Department of Epidemiology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health and the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
